1. (5 points) Class Vec
Here is a checklist for helping you complete the class Vec library code:

□ Start from the sample code at: https://replit.com/@Cong_Chen/20230223
DONE
□ Change struct to class
DONE
□ Make all the members private
DONE
□ Add get size, get capacity and get array methods

< bool DONE
== bool DONE
>= bool DONE
<= bool DONE
== bool DONE
!= bool DONE
□ Complete and debug all the other methods in the sample code, such as insert
done
